# File Upload and Processing Architecture Design

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the proposed architecture for integrating PDF/Doc and CSV file upload capabilities into the existing VoiceLoop HR platform. The goal is to enable intelligent processing of these files for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by extracting relevant information and storing it in a suitable format for retrieval.

## 2. Current Application Structure (from README.md analysis)
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js (inferred from `npm` usage), likely Express.js or similar.
- **Voice Services:** OpenAI Whisper (Speech-to-text), ElevenLabs (Text-to-speech).
- **Data Management:** Employee Records, Performance Metrics, Activity Feed. Uses local storage for persistence in sandbox mode, but a more robust database will be needed for RAG.

## 3. Proposed Architecture

### 3.1. File Upload
- **Frontend:** Implement a file upload component (e.g., using `input type=


"file"`) that allows users to select PDF, DOCX, and CSV files.
- **Backend:** Create new API endpoints to handle file uploads. These endpoints will receive the files and store them temporarily.

### 3.2. File Processing

#### 3.2.1. PDF/DOCX Processing
- **Text Extraction:** Utilize a library (e.g., `pdf-parse` for PDF, `mammoth` for DOCX) on the backend to extract raw text content from the uploaded documents.
- **Pre-processing:** Clean the extracted text (remove special characters, normalize whitespace, etc.).
- **Chunking:** Divide the text into smaller, manageable chunks suitable for RAG.
- **Embedding Generation:** Generate vector embeddings for each text chunk using an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings).

#### 3.2.2. CSV Processing
- **Data Parsing:** Parse the CSV file into a structured format (e.g., JSON array of objects).
- **Schema Inference/Validation:** Optionally, infer the schema of the CSV or validate against a predefined schema.
- **Intelligent Processing:** Depending on the content of the CSV, this could involve:
    - **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Extracting key entities (e.g., employee names, dates, performance metrics).
    - **Relationship Extraction:** Identifying relationships between entities.
    - **Data Transformation:** Converting data into a standardized format.
- **Embedding Generation:** Generate vector embeddings for relevant fields or combinations of fields in each row.

### 3.3. RAG Storage System
- **Vector Database:** Store the generated embeddings along with their original text chunks (or references to them) in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or a self-hosted solution like PGVector if using PostgreSQL).
- **Metadata Storage:** Store additional metadata about the documents/CSV files (e.g., filename, upload date, source, extracted entities) in a traditional database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) linked to the vector database entries.

### 3.4. RAG Integration
- **Query Embedding:** When a user asks a question, generate an embedding for the query.
- **Vector Search:** Use the query embedding to perform a similarity search in the vector database to retrieve relevant text chunks.
- **Contextualization:** Combine the retrieved text chunks with the user's query to create a rich context.
- **Language Model (LLM) Integration:** Pass the contextualized query to an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT models) to generate a more informed and accurate response.

## 4. Technologies to Consider
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js (Express.js or NestJS) for API development.
- **File Upload:** `multer` for handling multipart/form-data.
- **PDF Parsing:** `pdf-parse` or `pdf.js`.
- **DOCX Parsing:** `mammoth.js`.
- **CSV Parsing:** `csv-parser` or `papaparse`.
- **Embedding Models:** OpenAI Embeddings API.
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone, Weaviate, or PGVector.
- **Traditional Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT models.

## 5. Future Considerations
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error handling and logging for file processing.
- **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scalability of processing services.
- **Security:** Implement proper authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
- **User Interface for RAG:** Develop a user-friendly interface for querying the RAG system and displaying results.
- **Feedback Loop:** Mechanism for users to provide feedback on RAG results to improve accuracy.
